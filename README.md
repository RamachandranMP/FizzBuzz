# FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz API for Division

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a .net Web API which accepts array of input string, perform division on certain numbers and return logic based string results for each input based on the division operation.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
