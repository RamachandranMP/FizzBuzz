# FizzBuzz API

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a .net API which accepts array of input strings, perform division on certain numbers and return logic based string results for each input, based on the division operation.

Here's the business logic:
1.	If the value is a multiple of 3 then output the word “Fizz” 
2.	If the value is a multiple of 5 then output the word “Buzz” 
3.	If the value is divisible by both 3 and 5 then output the word “FizzBuzz” 
4.	At the end of the run the program should display each division that was performed.  
 
The table below shows a list of inputs and their corresponding expected outputs.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
